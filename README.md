# eCommerce-Transactions-Project
This project analyzes eCommerce transactions data to gain insights, build a Lookalike Model, and segment customers. It uses three datasets (Customers, Products, Transactions) to conduct EDA, discover business trends, create a model to identify similar customers, and group customers into distinct segments for targeted marketing.
